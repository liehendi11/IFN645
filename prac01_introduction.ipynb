It is used for wide range of purposes, from web servers to scientific computing. It’s syntax allows easy and quick readability and program creativity.\n",

    "The practical sessions in this subject use Python for data manipulation and analytics. This is **NOT** a Python unit, therefore, it will not cover the basic syntax of Python. Fortunately, there is a lot of resources available online for\n",

    "## 1. Why Python? <a name=\"whypython\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist many different languages, tools and software to perform data mining tasks. Some of them are R, Weka, Orange, Knime Analytics, SAS, Oracle Data Miner, Microsoft SQLServer Data Mining and Rapid Miner. Python is arguably the fastest growing and most widely used programming language/tool alongside R and Julia. There are a number of reasons for this popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Interpreted language\n",
    "Python is designed as an interpreted language which allows users to test and prototype models easily and quickly. With iPython interpreter, results of each line of code can immediately be checked. An interactive Jupyter notebook can also be created to share insights and code through browser interface. These tutorial notes are written in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Open-source\n",
    "Python is free and has no ties to any propertiary/corporate technologies, which makes Python the top choice for students, academics and startups. There are some libraries/technologies in Python that are tied to a company (e.g. Jupyter, tensorflow), but they are still available almost in all use cases for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Wide, cutting edge support for almost anything\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a vast range of actively updated libraries for almost every data mining task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pandas** for data wrangling and preprocessing ([link](http://pandas.pydata.org/))\n",
    "* **scikit-learn** for supervised and unsupervised learning ([link](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/))\n",
    "* **numpy** for matrix manipulation ([link](http://www.numpy.org/))\n",
    "* **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for visualisation ([link](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)) ([link2](https://matplotlib.org/))\n",
    "* **ipython** for interactive prototyping ([link](https://ipython.org/))\n",
    "* **jupyter notebook** for interactive, web-based prototyping ([link](http://jupyter.org/))\n",
    "* **graphviz** and **pydot** for visualising sklearn model structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Production ready\n",
    "Models and pipelines built with Python are very suitable to deployment in production systems. We will talk about deploying models and data pipelines in a practical later in this unit."

It contains many essential data science libraries and is aimed to simplify the installation process. At the time of these notes, all libraries mentioned above are in Anaconda distribution except Seaborn.\n",

    "4. Make sure git is installed in your system.\n",
    "5. Go to Anaconda Prompt using start menu (Make sure to right click and select \"Run as Administrator\". We may get permission issues if Prompt as not opened as Administrator)\n",
    "6. Execute the command: `conda install graphviz`\n",

    "\n",
    "For Linux users, go to Anaconda website to get the installation file [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Choose the latest Python3 version. It should download an `.sh` file. Once the download process is finished, open your terminal and give execution permission with command `chmod +x [path_to_the_downloaded file]`. Run it to install by `./[path_to_downloaded file]`.\n",

    "The diagram above presents the steps we will take in this unit to perform predictive mining on the dataset. It is a standard data mining process that includes business understanding, data understanding, data pre-processing, data mining and post-processing. Some of these steps are done iteratively. The first and most important step is to define the underlying task and purpose of data mining. You need to ask questions such as:\n",

In this step, we attempt to understand common patterns and distributions in the data. We should also identify data quality problems in the dataset, such as noise and missing values, to be cleaned and processed out. The data exploration and quality enhancement steps will be performed mainly using `pandas` with some help from `sklearn`'s preprocessing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data is clean, models can be built to perform in-depth analysis. There are two broad categories of data mining: **Predictive Mining** (e.g. classification and regression with decision tree, regression and neural network) and **Descriptive Mining** (e.g. clustering and association mining). Many algorithms belonging to each of the categories are available in `sklearn`, each with its own characteristics. The upcoming practical notes will explore some of these algorithms in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data mining outcomes ate best understood when accompanied with graphs and charts of patterns and trends identified in the data. Visualisation allows us to understand the data better. In this unit, all visualisations will be done using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` with data presented by `pandas` DataFrames."

Of particular interest is the class of individuals identified as lapsing donors. They have ran a greeting card mailing campaign called **Veteran**. The organisation now seeks to classify its lapsing donors based on their responses to this campaign. With this classification, a decision can be made to either solicit or ignore a lapsing individual in the next year campaign.\n",
