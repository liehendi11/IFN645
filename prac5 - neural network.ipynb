    "The practical note for this week introduces you to neural network mining in Python, particularly using multilayer perceptron classifier. Neural networks are a class of predictive models that mimic the structure of human brain. It consists of layers of neurons, each consuming outputs from the previous layers as inputs. Neural network is the most complex model out of everything that we have used so far.\n",

    "## 4. Finding optimal hyperparameter with GridSearchCV\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have trained our first neural network, we should tune it to increase its performance using GridSearchCV. Neural network is one of the hardest models to tune due to its relatively high number of parameters and slow training process. For this tutorial, let's focus on tuning two parameters:\n",
    "1. `hidden_layer_sizes`: It has values of tuples, and within each tuple, element i-th represent the number of neurons contained in each hidden layer.\n",
    "2. `alpha`: L2 regularization parameter used in each neuron's activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's start by tuning the hidden layer sizes. There is no official guideline on how many neurons we should have in each layer, but for most cases it is sufficient to have a single hidden layer with neurons count between `number of features` (input variables) and `output neurons` (in this case, it is 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun Fact:** You might have heard of deep learning, which is a process of building very complex neural networks (these models often have hundreds of layers and thousands of neurons, hence **deep**). They are typically used for high level tasks, like image recognition, Siri-like voice assistant, machine translation and beating Go world champion. You might contribute in building the next Skynet here... :)\n",

    "Here, you can see the curve for different models. `LogisticRegression` again has the largest curve area compared to the other two models. Thus, all three statistics that we used collectively agreed on `LogisticRegression` being the best performing model overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "While statistics are vital, in a real project, performance is not always the priority. Some of the other aspects used to consider a best model are:\n",
    "1. Interpretability: how well can humans use the model to make decisions. Decision trees (and regressions to some extent) excel at this, while neural network not so much.\n",
    "2. Speed: how well can the model train and predict on large amount of data. Again decision trees and regressions are relatively fast, while neural networks take a while to train.\n",
    "3. Adaptability: in some cases, you want your model to slowly adapt to the data trend. Neural networks are great for this as they can be trained using \"online training\", while decision trees are not so great.\n",

    "This week, we learned how to build, tune and explore the structure of neural network models. We also explored dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the size of the feature set and improve performance of our neural network model. In addition, we tried numerous statistics to compare end-to-end performance of all models we have built so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week, we will have a drop-in help session where you focus on the assignment and ask your tutor questions regarding it."
