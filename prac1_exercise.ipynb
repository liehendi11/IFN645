    "To answer conceptual questions, write the answer to each question on a paper/note with your reasoning. For programming exercises, open your iPython console/Jupyter notebook and use Python commands/libraries introduced in each practical to answer the questions. In many cases, you will need to write code to support your conceptual answers."
